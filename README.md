# Color Sound Organ: PCB-3D-Enclosure
This project contains a complete design for a **sound-reactive light organ** with 3 channels (bass, mid, treble), using a PCB designed in KiCad and a custom 3D-printed case modeled in FreeCAD.
It is intended as a simple analog project for beginners or hobbyists who want to create visual effects based on audio input.

## üß† Functional Description

The circuit detects three different frequency bands from an audio signal (low, mid, and high), and lights up a dedicated LED for each band accordingly.

- **Low frequencies (bass)** ‚Üí LED 1
- **Mid frequencies** ‚Üí LED 2
- **High frequencies (treble)** ‚Üí LED 3

The PCB is designed to fit perfectly into the custom enclosure, with holes for LEDs and power input.
