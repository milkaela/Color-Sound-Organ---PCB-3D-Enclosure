// This is a placeholder sketch to classify the repository as an Arduino-related hardware project.

// Project Summary:
// This repository contains a sound-reactive 3-channel light organ,
// designed entirely using KiCad (PCB) and FreeCAD (3D enclosure).
// It is an analog circuit that lights up 3 LEDs based on bass, mid, and treble frequencies.

// Technologies Involved:
// - KiCad: for PCB layout and schematic
// - FreeCAD: for 3D printable enclosure
// - Passive and analog active filters: frequency band separation
// - Hardware assembly and real-world testing

// This project demonstrates hardware design skills,
// analog electronics knowledge, and full project integration (from schematic to physical build).

void setup() {
  // Nothing to run â€” this file is here for classification and documentation only.
}

void loop() {
  // No code needed for analog project.
}
